The files in these directories show how to use the C API. Each example is
standalone. The examples use a trivial objective function who optimal point
and value are clear from looking at it, although examples involving constrained
or bounded optimization will make sure to use active constraints (in order to 
demonstrate their usage) and so will not arrive at the same optimal point as
the unconstrained problem.
